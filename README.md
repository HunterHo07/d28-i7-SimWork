# SimWork: The Future of Work Simulation Platform

![SimWork Logo](public/favicon.webp)

## About SimWork

SimWork is an AI-driven, immersive "future of work" game that revolutionizes corporate and educational training. Our platform addresses critical gaps in traditional training methods by combining real-world tasks with adaptive difficulty, OCR-enabled asset submission, and real-time analytics.

## Key Features

### 🌐 Immersive, Multi-Role Game World
SimWork places users in a 3D office environment with stations for various roles:
- Developer
- Designer
- Project Manager
- Data Entry
- AI Engineer

Users navigate to desks equipped with real terminals (Cloud VS Code), virtual notebooks, and design tools to complete authentic tasks that mirror on-the-job workflows.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Adaptivity & Agents
Our platform features integrated GPT-based agents that:
- Guide scenarios
- Perform OCR on designer-submitted assets
- Dynamically adjust task complexity

This prevents mis-hires by exposing candidates to true job demands before onboarding.

### 📊 Real-Time Analytics & Feedback
A comprehensive dashboard tracks KPIs:
- Accuracy
- Speed
- Decision quality

The system generates personalized feedback loops and offers hiring managers live or recorded sessions—bridging learning and evaluation in one platform.

## Why SimWork?

### Problems We Solve

#### 🔄 Wrong Hires, Wasted Money
Companies keep hiring the wrong people—time, salary, and training costs wasted. Real candidates also lose out due to bad screening and vague interviews.

#### 🎭 Fake Skills, No Real Test
Many hires pass interviews but fail on the job. There's no hands-on task or live environment to prove they can actually do the daily work—even with AI tools.

#### ⏱️ Slow, Inefficient Hiring Process
Too many rounds, test sheets, and guesswork. No live data, no real output. Hiring managers waste time when they could just watch candidates solve actual tasks.

#### 📈 No KPI or Proof of Skill
Current systems don't track real performance. Without real-time KPIs, logs, and session recordings, it's all talk—no proof.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Phased Rollout

### 🧩 Phase 1 (MVP): Web-Based 2.5D Simulation Game
SimWork begins as a web-based 2.5D simulation game where users navigate a stylized office or workspace. Players create a character, explore different departments, and receive procedurally generated quests tailored to their selected role or skill area.

### 🚀 Future Phases
- Phase 2: Desktop/mobile apps, expanded role scenarios
- Phase 3: VR/AR integration, multiplayer enterprise modules
