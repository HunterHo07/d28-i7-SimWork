## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.2 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom utility classes
- **State Management**: React Context API and localStorage
- **Animations**: GSAP for complex animations, Framer Motion for UI components
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js with OrbitControls for the demo environment

### Key Components
- **SimulationContext**: Manages the simulation state, including selected role, tasks, and progress
- **useSimulation3D**: Custom hook for managing the 3D environment and interactions
- **UI Components**: Button, Card, Section components for consistent UI
- **Home Components**: Hero, Features, ProblemSolution, etc. for the homepage
- **Demo Components**: RoleSelection, SimulationView for the demo page

### Data Management
- All data is stored locally using dummy JSON and localStorage
- No backend or database required for the MVP
- Simulated API responses for task completion and progress tracking

## Next Steps
1. Complete the remaining pages (Pitch Deck, Why Us, Roadmap, Showcase)
2. Conduct thorough testing across different devices and browsers
3. Optimize performance and accessibility
4. Prepare for deployment to Vercel
5. Create a presentation for stakeholders

## Conclusion
The SimWork MVP has successfully implemented the core features of the platform, including the homepage and demo page. The application provides a realistic simulation of the work environment with different roles and tasks, demonstrating the value proposition of SimWork as a training and assessment tool. The next steps will focus on completing the additional pages and preparing the application for deployment.
